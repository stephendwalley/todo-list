# todo-list

Items and features to work on: (see todo file for more info);
 - Make it check if there is scheduled date: if scheduled display date, if not then display button to schedule task (displayProject.js)
 - Find a way to reload the project list page after closing modal (displayTodoItem.js)
 - If trying to either close module or open up another edit for a different quality, and another module is already open for editing 
   without having saved or cancelled, check with user to confirm whether they want to save changes or delete. (displayTodoItem.js)


 -  save current project by highlighting project list project with a tag of currentProject and giving a basic css change. Thus, when refreshing the page after editing,
    function can be run to get current project and call displayProject(currentProject);

 - fix undefined display when no todo info; fix todo display to show titles of each topic; and css to make input boxes match website style
